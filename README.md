# [Julie](https://julie-travel-planner.herokuapp.com/), AI for exploring cities.  

### About

  Julie is a simple AI web app that takes in to account your location and preferences and
  helps you plan your day 3 options at a time. Julie will calculate travel time and
  estimate the amount of time you are likely to spend at various locations through
  an algorithm that derives a length of time based the type of location the user has selected.
  The User interface is smooth and responsive providing a great user experience regardless
  of the device or browser she is being accessed from. Users are able to use the app
  without logging in and are able to login with Facebook to save the itinerary for viewing
  in the future.
